# Invoice Dashboard - Issues Fixed

## üîß Issues Addressed

### 1. Customer Names Showing N/A & Item Count Zero ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Dashboard table showing "N/A" for customers and "0 items" 
**Fix**: 
- Optimized `getInvoices()` to use batch fetching instead of individual queries
- Fixed the data enrichment process to properly map receivers and items
- Added debug logging to track data flow

### 2. CSV Export Not Working ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Export CSV button did nothing
**Fix**: 
- Implemented complete CSV export functionality in `handleExportCSV()`
- Fetches all invoices (not just current page) with applied filters
- Exports comprehensive data including customer info, items, taxes
- Auto-downloads file with timestamp

### 3. Filters Not Working Properly ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Date and amount filters not applying correctly
**Fix**: 
- Fixed filter application to use the same query for both count and data
- Customer filter now properly handles pagination
- Improved filter logic with better error handling

### 4. Dark/Light Theme Not Working ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Theme toggle not syncing across components
**Fix**: 
- Made theme defaults consistent (false = light mode)
- Added custom event dispatching for theme changes
- Improved localStorage synchronization
- Dashboard now listens to Navigation theme changes

## üß™ How to Test

### Test Customer Names & Item Counts
1. Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Invoices section
2. You should see customer names instead of "N/A"
3. Item counts should show actual numbers
4. Check browser console for debug logs

### Test CSV Export
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "üìä Export CSV" button
3. Should see success notification
4. CSV file should download automatically
5. Open CSV to verify all invoice data is included

### Test Filters
1. Use date range filter (start and end date)
2. Use amount range filter (min and max)
3. Use customer name filter (type partial name)
4. Apply filters and verify results update
5. Clear filters to reset

### Test Dark/Light Theme
1. Toggle theme using sun/moon icon in navigation
2. Dashboard should immediately update colors
3. Refresh page - theme should persist
4. Open multiple tabs - theme should sync

## üîç Debug Commands

Open browser console and test:

```javascript
// Test database connection
await invoiceService.testConnection()

// Test invoice fetching
await invoiceService.getInvoices(1, 10, {})

// Test with filters
await invoiceService.getInvoices(1, 10, {
  customer: 'ACME',
  startDate: '2025-01-01',
  endDate: '2025-12-31'
})
```

## üìã Expected Results

2. **Customer names appear correctly**
3. **Item counts show real numbers**
4. **CSV export downloads complete data**
5. **All filters work and update results**
6. **Theme toggle works instantly and persists**

## üö® If Issues Persist

1. **Check Supabase Setup**: Run `fix_foreign_keys.sql` in SQL Editor
2. **Add Test Data**: Run `test_data.sql` if no invoices appear
3. **Check Console**: Look for specific error messages
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes helps with localStorage issues
