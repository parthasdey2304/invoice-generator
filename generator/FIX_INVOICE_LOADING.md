# Fix for Invoice Loading Issue

## Problem
Supabase is returning this error:
```
"Could not find a relationship between 'invoices' and 'receivers' in the schema cache"
```

This means the foreign key relationship isn't properly established in Supabase.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Fix Foreign Key Relationships
1. Go to your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the contents of `fix_foreign_keys.sql` 
3. This will drop and recreate the foreign key constraints properly

### Step 2: Test with Simplified Function
The Dashboard is now temporarily using `getInvoicesSimple()` which avoids all joins. This should:
- Load basic invoice data without relationships
- Prove that the basic database connection works
- Show if the issue is specifically with foreign key joins

### Step 3: Run Test Data (If Needed)
If no invoices appear, run `test_data.sql` in Supabase to add sample data.

### Step 4: Switch Back to Full Function
Once foreign keys are fixed, change Dashboard.jsx back to use `getInvoices()` instead of `getInvoicesSimple()`.

## Files Updated
- `invoiceService.js`: Added optimized batch fetching and debugging functions
- `Dashboard.jsx`: Temporarily using simplified invoice fetching
- `fix_foreign_keys.sql`: New script to fix foreign key relationships

## Next Steps
1. Run `fix_foreign_keys.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Refresh your React app
3. Check browser console - should see "Using simplified invoice fetch..." message
4. If invoices load, run `test_data.sql` to add sample data
5. Switch back to full `getInvoices()` function once foreign keys are working

## Console Commands for Testing
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Test basic connection
await invoiceService.testConnection()

// Test simplified fetch
await invoiceService.getInvoicesSimple(1, 10, {})
```

This should help identify exactly where the issue lies.
