# 🔧 CGST & SGST Tax Display Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
CGST and SGST were not appearing in the generated invoice PDF despite being entered in the form.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The issue was in data structure mismatch between the form and invoice generator:

### Form Structure (Nested):
```javascript
formData = {
  taxDetails: {
    cgst: '9',
    sgst: '9',
    showCgst: true,
    showSgst: true,
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Invoice Generator Expected (Flat):
```javascript
data = {
  cgst: '9',
  sgst: '9', 
  showCgst: true,
  showSgst: true,
  // ...
}
```

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Data Flattening in InvoiceForm.jsx**
- Updated `handleSubmit` function to flatten tax details before passing to invoice generator
- Now properly maps nested `taxDetails` to flat properties

### 2. **Enhanced Invoice Generator Logic**
- Added proper visibility checks using `showCgst`, `showSgst`, etc. flags
- Taxes only appear when:
  - ✅ Checkbox is checked (`showCgst: true`)
  - ✅ Value is greater than 0 (`cgst > 0`)
- Dynamic line spacing for tax section

### 3. **Improved PDF Layout**
- Dynamic positioning for bank details based on number of tax lines shown
- QR code and footer positioning adjust automatically
- Better spacing and alignment

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### Test Case 1: CGST & SGST
1. Fill invoice form
2. ✅ **Check CGST checkbox** and enter value (e.g., 9)
3. ✅ **Check SGST checkbox** and enter value (e.g., 9)
4. Submit form and generate PDF
5. **Expected**: Both CGST @ 9% and SGST @ 9% should appear in PDF

### Test Case 2: Only IGST
1. Fill invoice form
2. ✅ **Check IGST checkbox** and enter value (e.g., 18)
3. ❌ **Uncheck CGST and SGST checkboxes**
4. Submit form and generate PDF
5. **Expected**: Only IGST @ 18% should appear in PDF

### Test Case 3: Mixed Taxes
1. Fill invoice form
2. ✅ **Check CGST (9%), Other Charges (100), Rounded Off**
3. ❌ **Uncheck SGST, IGST, Less Discount**
4. Submit form and generate PDF
5. **Expected**: Only checked items should appear in PDF

## 📋 **Files Modified**

1. **`src/components/InvoiceForm.jsx`**
   - Fixed `handleSubmit` function to flatten tax details
   - Added proper data mapping for invoice generator

2. **`src/components/InvoiceGenerator.jsx`**
   - Added visibility flags checking
   - Dynamic tax line rendering
   - Improved PDF layout and positioning

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

✅ **CGST appears when checkbox checked and value > 0**
✅ **SGST appears when checkbox checked and value > 0**  
✅ **IGST appears when checkbox checked and value > 0**
✅ **Other charges/discounts appear based on checkboxes**
✅ **PDF layout adjusts dynamically**
✅ **Calculations are correct**

## 🚨 **Before vs After**

### Before (Broken):
- Form had tax values but PDF showed 0% for all taxes
- All tax lines appeared even when unchecked
- Fixed positioning caused layout issues

### After (Fixed):
- Tax values from form properly appear in PDF
- Only checked tax lines are displayed
- Dynamic layout adjusts based on visible taxes
- Proper calculations and formatting

The CGST and SGST should now properly appear in your generated invoices! 🎉
